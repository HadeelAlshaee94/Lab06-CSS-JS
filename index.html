         <p><h3> <br> <br> <br> A wild animal is an animal that is, well, wild. This means that it isn't tame and it lives on its own without any help from people. A wild animal finds its own food, shelter, water and all its other needs in a specific natural habitat. Habitat can be a field, woods, pond, wetland, prairie, park, or your yard. Wild animals make their home in both the city and the country. Wildlife includes small critters that you can only see through a microscope to animals as large as whales! (Although, you won't find any whales in Wisconsin.) In the spring and early summer you might discover young animals in the wild. They are often cute, helpless and seem friendly. It might look like the animals are abandoned or orphaned, but the parent is usually around. Adult wild animals leave their young in hiding for a short time while they search for food.

           <br>
           Sometimes a wild animal is scared away from its young, but it will return to feed or care for the young animal once danger has passed. This can happen anywhere, even in your backyard. The baby rabbit or young robin you find in your yard has a mother somewhere close by.

If you see or find a baby animal, it is best to leave the area quietly to let the adult animal return as soon as possible. If you know that the young animal is orphaned because the adult animal has died, leave it alone and tell an adult. Adults can contact professional wildlife staff to learn what to do. Remember: wildlife belongs in the wild!

 animal species disappears every 20 minutes… 26% of mammals, 42% of amphibians, 30% of sharks and rays and 13% of birds are endangered. 23928 animal species out of the 82,954 studied are classified as endangered (last edition of the 2016 World Red List). This massive disappearance, described as the 6th extinction  crisis , is of an abnormally high speed and is accelerating exponentially… At this rate and if nothing is done,  wildlife will be no more than ‘A memory that our children will discover in a beautiful picture book… The numbers speak for themselves, yet wildlife is dying in indifference… There is clearly  NO WILDLIFE ASSISTANCE… The hour is no longer to the awareness, to say that Is urgent to act is a euphemism, and the actions carried out by lovers of Nature remain clearly and unfortunately insufficient to reverse the movement…

Wildlife traditionally refers to undomesticated animal species, but has come to include all organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans. Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, forests, rainforests, plains, grasslands, and other areas, including the most developed urban areas, all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by human factors, most scientists agree that much wildlife is affected by human activities.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Humans have historically tended to separate civilization from wildlife in a number of ways, including the legal, social, and moral senses. Some animals, however, have adapted to suburban environments. This includes such animals as domesticated cats, dogs, mice, and rats. Some religions declare certain animals to be sacred, and in modern times, concern for the natural environment has provoked activists to protest against the exploitation of wildlife for human benefit or entertainment.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Global wildlife populations have decreased by 68% since 1970 as a result of human activity, particularly overconsumption, population growth and intensive farming, according to a 2020 World Wildlife Fund's Living Planet Report and the Zoological Society of London's Living Planet Index measure, which is further evidence that humans have unleashed a sixth mass extinction event.According to CITES, it has been estimated that annually the international wildlife trade amounts to billions of dollars and it affects hundreds of millions of animal and plant specimen.
